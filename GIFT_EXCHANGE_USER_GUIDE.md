# Gift Exchange User Guide

Welcome to the Gift Exchange feature! This guide will help you understand how to use gift exchanges to coordinate presents with your friends and family.

## What is a Gift Exchange?

A Gift Exchange is a group where members can see each other's wishlist purchaser information, but not random people from the internet. This helps you coordinate gifts without spoiling surprises!

## Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Privacy**: You never see who's buying items from your own wishlist  
‚úÖ **Coordination**: See when people in your exchange have signed up to purchase items  
‚úÖ **No Interference**: Random people signing up won't confuse your gift planning  
‚úÖ **Multiple Groups**: Join different exchanges for family, work friends, etc.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Click the "Login" button in the navigation bar
2. Choose your preferred wallet or sign-in method
3. Follow the prompts to connect

### Step 2: Sign In

1. After connecting your wallet, click the "Sign In" button (shield icon)
2. Sign the message with your wallet to authenticate
3. You'll see "Sign Out" appear when you're signed in

**Note**: Signing in is required to create/join exchanges and see filtered purchaser lists.

### Step 3: Create or Join an Exchange

#### Creating a New Exchange

1. Navigate to "Exchanges" in the main menu
2. Click "Create Exchange"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Smith Family Christmas 2024")
4. Optionally add a description
5. Click "Create Exchange"
6. Share the 6-character invite code with your group members

#### Joining an Existing Exchange

1. Get the invite code from your exchange organizer
2. Navigate to "Exchanges" in the main menu
3. Click "Join Exchange"
4. Enter the invite code
5. Click "Join Exchange"

## How It Works

### For Wishlist Owners (That's You!)

When viewing your own wishlist:

- ‚ùå You **cannot** see who has signed up to purchase your items
- üéÅ This keeps the surprise of receiving gifts!
- üìã You can still add, edit, and remove items normally

### For Purchasers (Viewing Someone Else's List)

When viewing a wishlist of someone in your exchange:

- ‚úÖ You **can** see how many people from your exchange have shown interest
- ‚úÖ You **can** see who specifically from your exchange has signed up
- ‚ùå You **cannot** see random people outside your exchange who signed up
- üéØ This helps you avoid duplicate gifts within your group

### For Everyone Else

When viewing a wishlist of someone NOT in your exchange:

- üëÄ You see all purchasers (normal behavior)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But you don't know who's in their private exchanges

## Example Scenario

**The Smith Family Example**:

1. **Mom** creates an exchange called "Smith Family" and gets code `ABC123`
2. **Dad**, **Sister**, and **Brother** all join using code `ABC123`
3. **Mom** adds an item to her wishlist: "Kitchen Mixer"
4. **Random Internet Person** signs up as a purchaser for the mixer
5. **Dad** views Mom's wishlist:
   - Sees: 0 people from the family have signed up
   - Doesn't see: Random Internet Person
   - Dad knows it's safe to sign up without duplicating
6. **Dad** signs up as a purchaser
7. **Sister** views Mom's wishlist:
   - Sees: Dad has signed up
   - Knows: Someone in the family is getting it
   - Doesn't sign up to avoid duplicate

## Managing Your Exchanges

### Viewing Exchange Members

1. Go to "Exchanges" page
2. Click "View Members" on any exchange
3. See all members and when they joined

### Leaving an Exchange

1. Go to "Exchanges" page
2. Find the exchange you want to leave
3. Click "Leave"
4. Confirm you want to leave

**Note**: If you leave an exchange, you'll need the invite code to rejoin.

### Deleting an Exchange

Exchanges are automatically deleted when the last member leaves. There's no manual delete function.

## Tips & Best Practices

### üéØ Organizing Exchanges

- **Use descriptive names**: "Smith Family Christmas 2024" instead of just "Family"
- **Add descriptions**: Explain what the exchange is for
- **One exchange per event**: Create separate exchanges for different occasions

### üë• Inviting Members

- **Share codes securely**: Send invite codes via private message, not public posts
- **Double-check codes**: Codes are case-sensitive and exactly 6 characters
- **Keep codes handy**: Save the code somewhere in case someone needs to rejoin

### üéÅ Coordinating Gifts

- **Check before signing up**: Always check if exchange members have signed up first
- **Communicate**: Consider setting up a group chat for coordination
- **Be transparent**: Let exchange members know if you've purchased something

### üîê Privacy & Security

- **Sign out when done**: Click "Sign Out" on shared devices
- **Don't share tokens**: Never share your authentication information
- **Trust your exchanges**: Only join exchanges with people you trust

## Troubleshooting

### "Please connect your wallet first"

**Problem**: Trying to access exchanges without connecting  
**Solution**: Click "Login" in the navigation and connect your wallet

### "Please sign in to create/join exchanges"

**Problem**: Wallet is connected but not signed in  
**Solution**: Click the "Sign In" button (shield icon) and sign the message

### Can't see purchasers on my own wishlist

**Problem**: Wondering why purchaser count shows 0 on your items  
**Solution**: This is intentional! Owners cannot see purchaser information to keep gifts a surprise.

### Seeing all purchasers, not just exchange members

**Problem**: Expected to see only exchange members but seeing everyone  
**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're signed in (shield icon shows "Sign Out")
2. Verify you're actually in an exchange with the wishlist owner
3. Check that the person whose list you're viewing is in your exchange

### Invite code doesn't work

**Problem**: "Invalid invite code" error  
**Solution**:

1. Double-check the code is exactly 6 characters
2. Make sure it's all uppercase (codes are case-sensitive)
3. Ask the creator to verify the code hasn't changed
4. Check if the exchange still exists (creator might have left)

### Lost my invite code

**Problem**: Need to share the code but forgot it  
**Solution**:

1. Go to "Exchanges" page
2. Find your exchange
3. The invite code is displayed prominently
4. Click "Copy" to copy it to clipboard
